# artboard-contains-external-css-asset
 
Artboards must contain at least one text layer named {externalasset.css} as a direct decendant.
 
## Rationale
 
{externalasset.css} is used within the [Sketch2React](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/)
framework to target external CSS assets (fonts, local CSS-files etc.) that should be included in the generated output.
 
## Options
None.
